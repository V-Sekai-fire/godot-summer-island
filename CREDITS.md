This project is a recreation based on a scene from Boku no Natsuyasumi 2. Boku no Natsuyasumi 2 is created and owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment. This is an unofficial fan work.

I used some [Godot design elements](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-design) like its logo and Godette character design under the license of Creative Commons License 4.0 Attribution.

Godette chracter model is made by linuxkone9. It's [available](https://www.blendswap.com/blend/22276) on Blend Swap.

This project uses [Qodot](https://github.com/ShiftyAxel/Qodot), the Quake map importer for Godot, and [HungryProton's Scatter plugin](https://github.com/HungryProton/scatter).

I used and modified many textures from [3D TEXTURES](https://3dtextures.me/) and [CC0 Textures](https://cc0textures.com/).

I used [Materialize](http://boundingboxsoftware.com/materialize/) for some textures.
