## IMPORTANT
This project is a re-creation based on a scene from Sony Interactive Entertainment's 2002 game Boku no Natsuyasumi 2. While I didn't use any of assets directly from the game, this is a derivative work so keep that in mind and use these assets at your own dicrestion and responsibility.

Also [loading art](https://github.com/sunkper/Project-Summer-Island/blob/master/images/CoverArtCDVer.png) is directly copied from the box art of the game.

## Assets Based on Godot's Design Assets
This scene uses some of design elements from [Godot's design assets](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-design) under the license of Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International. You can use modified assets here under the same license. See the license text [here](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

## The Touhou Project References
This scene includes a few references to [a certain Touhou Project character](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Yuuka_Kazami). (Framed picture of the flower girl on the wall, a poster of Flowers in one of the rooms in the background house.) If you want to re-use this scene they may not be suitable for your project. They're minor elements so I think you can easily replace or removem them. But if you want to keep them be sure to check out translated copies of the terms on deriviative works of Touhou [here](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki:Copyrights#Copyright_status.2FTerms_of_Use_of_the_Touhou_Project).
